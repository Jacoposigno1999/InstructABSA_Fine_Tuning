Chalito_Rambla,"Ok, this place is terrible! Came here bc weâ€™ve always walked around and it seems busy and it looked like we may like it.  Not the case at all. We arrived and put our name down for a table and were told 30 min wait, sure no problem. I went ahead and checked in again after 40 min and still nothing. Finally after 1hr we got a table. Since it was already late and we were starving we knew what we wanted and ordered right away.  We ordered a Margarita pizza and two empanadas. The margarita pizza was a Plain cheese pizza. The two empanadas: one was chicken the other capris. They both had cold centers. It was terrible! We ask for the check right after and got nothing! I had to get up and bring my credit card to the waitress to the cash register. It was just terrible service and terrible food. Spain is really disappointing me In the food department.

Chalito_Rambla,"This place was a great surprise. The food is delicious, desserts as well. Very close to Plaza Catalunya, so its a good stop for lunch after or before shopping.

Chalito_Rambla,I visited this placed yesterday to catch a quick bite before heading for the airport. We were greeted by a young man at the entrance who told use we could choose where we sat. We sat down and spent the next 5min or so being ignored. My partner was getting annoyed even so that the 3 young lads at the next table picked up on this and gave us their menus as they had already orderd. Again we spent some time being ignored before we stopped one of the staff walking by to take our order. The good came out quite quickly and to be fair it was very good. After we had finished we again had to ask the staff to clear the table and give us a dessert menu. The lad that we hsd asked wss just finishing and he told us to ask one of his other colleagues who he pointed to. My partner went over and asked for the menu and was told that there was none and that he had had to go inside the restaurant to the counter and pick out what he wanted which was on display and then tell her.  When I went to the counter to pay the male member behind the counter was on his phone. The female member that was there had to hit him with a washcloth to get his attention that I was there. I was paying by card and he never spoke to me and just gestured with his head to ask me to remove my card. The food here is good but the staff definitely need to be given a course on good customer service. I could understand this attitude if the place was seriously under pressure and extremely busy but the place was fairly quiet.,"[{'term': 'greeting', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'term': 'seating', 'polarity': 'neutral'}, {'term': 'wait time (at start)', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'term': 'service (overall)', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'term': 'food', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'dessert menu', 'polarity': 'neutral'}, {'term': 'clearing table', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'term': 'staff (individual 1)', 'polarity': 'mixed'}, {'term': 'payment process', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'term': 'attitude of staff', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'term': ""ambience (implied by 'quiet place')"", 'polarity': 'neutral'}]"
